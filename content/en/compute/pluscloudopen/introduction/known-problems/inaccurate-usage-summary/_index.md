If you compare the consumption data in the Horizon Dashboard with that on your bill, you will see that the display in Horizon differs from the data in the bill. The reason for this is that the display in Horizon is very inaccurate and we do not use it as a raw data source for billing. So please consider these values more as information (approximate value) of your consumption. A detailed overview of running costs will soon be integrated into our Cloud Hub.
