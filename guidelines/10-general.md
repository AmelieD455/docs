# General Documentation Guidelines

## Purpose

The purpose of these documentation guidelines is to ensure consistency, accuracy, and quality in the documentation across all contributors. By following these guidelines, we can maintain a high-quality and easily maintainable documentation that serves as a valuable resource for our users.

## General Guidelines

- Use the latest version of Markdown: Ensure your documentation is written in the latest version of Markdown syntax to avoid compatibility issues.
- Write clear and concise language: Use simple, straightforward language that is easy for readers to understand. Avoid jargon and technical terms unless they are essential for the context.
- Use proper grammar and punctuation: Ensure your writing is free of grammatical errors and typos. Use correct punctuation to enhance readability and clarity.
- Use consistent formatting: Maintain consistent formatting throughout the documentation, including heading levels, bullet points, and code blocks.
- Use screenshots and code examples: When appropriate, include screenshots to illustrate concepts and code examples to demonstrate syntax and usage.
- Link to related documentation: Provide links to relevant documentation within the same repository or to external resources when applicable.

## Picture Guidelines

- Use base64 encoded Pictures directly in the document. 

## Commit Guidelines

- Use a descriptive commit message: Provide clear and informative commit messages that accurately reflect the changes made.
- Commit frequently: Small, incremental commits are easier to review and merge than large, monolithic commits.
- Include relevant reviewers: Assign relevant reviewers to each commit to ensure timely feedback and maintain code quality.
- Use the GitHub issue tracker: For significant changes or new features, create corresponding GitHub issues to track progress and gather feedback.

## Testing Guidelines

- Manually review changes: After committing changes, manually review the documentation to ensure it is free of errors and inconsistencies.

## Workflow Guidelines

- Create branches for new features or changes: Use dedicated branches for new features or major changes to maintain a clean and organized repository.
- Rebase feature branches: Before submitting pull requests, rebase feature branches onto the main branch to ensure a linear history.
- Squash commits into logical units: Squash commits into logical units for easier review and comprehension.
- Use pull requests for code review: Submit pull requests for code review to gather feedback from other contributors and ensure code quality.

## Documentation Update Guidelines

- Regularly review and update documentation: Regularly review the documentation to ensure it remains up-to-date with the latest changes and features.
- Notify contributors of updates: Inform contributors of documentation updates through the project's communication channels.
- Promote documentation usage: Encourage the use of documentation by referencing it in tutorials, guides, and other communication materials.

By following these guidelines, we can establish a collaborative and efficient workflow for maintaining high-quality documentation that serves as a valuable resource for our users.
